# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 3rd, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the tribute page, first free code camp project 

**Thoughts:** was struggling with getting the <ul> to the center of the page but basic css like width: and margin:auto helped that issue

### Day 1: May 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished with the introduction to python module on hackerrank and tried starting with Portfolio Page(Second Project of FreeCodeCamp)

**Thoughts:** Pyhton was fine, felt a little motivated but beginning with the portfolio page was tough. Could not get hold of the bootstrap
